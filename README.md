Write a program that will output the names and IDs of everyone who is likely to buy some Tom Brady merchandise. For this exercise, we’ll use anyone who has commented on a post on his fanpage in the past 24hrs as an indicator of interest. You can write the program in any language you’re comfortable with, but make sure your code is well-organized and shareable.

Where To Start:
---------------
 - the [Tom Brady fanpage](https://www.facebook.com/TomBrady)
 - the facebook [Graph API reference for Pages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page)
 - the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/145634995501895/?method=GET&path=TomBrady&version=v2.4) to test APIs (it’s okay to hard code an access token or take one in as an input parameter instead of  - doing actual OAuth)

Bonus
-----
 - make your program work for any athlete/page
 - make your program work for any arbitrary time range (longer than 24hrs)
 - if you weren’t going to anyways, write your program in Python or Node

Deliverables
------------
Fork this repository and write your code in your own private branch. Edit this `README.md` file with instructions on how to execute whatever code you write. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) when your code is complete.
